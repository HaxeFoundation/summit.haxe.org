        <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
        <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
        <p>The Haxe Summit Team believes our community should be open and welcoming for everyone. As such, we are
            committed to providing a positive environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability,
            ethnicity, or religion.
            This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior as well as the consequences for
            unacceptable behavior.
            We invite all sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, media, exhibitors, and other participants to help
            us realize a positive conference experience for everyone.
            All determinations of appropriate or inappropriate behavior are in the Haxe Summit Team’s sole discretion
            and the decision(s) of the Haxe Summit Team’s representatives onsite will be final.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Be considerate.</h2>
        <p>Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative towards each other. We all depend on each other to make the
            conference a successful and positive experience for everyone.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Be respectful.</h2>
        We will not all agree all the time, differences of opinion will happen, they are an integral part of productive
        dialogue. However, disagreement is not an excuse for disrespectful behavior. We all get frustrated from time to
        time, but that frustration can not be allowed to culminate in personal attacks. An environment charged with
        threats is not a productive and creative environment.
        <h2>4. Choose your words and actions carefully.</h2>
        Always conduct yourself with integrity and politeness. Be kind to others, do not insult them or put them down.
        Harassment and exclusionary behavior is not acceptable.
        This includes:
        Threats of violence
        Personal insults
        Unwelcome sexual attention
        Violence (verbal, mental, or physical)
        Encouraging or advocating the above behavior
        In short, if you can not say it in a kind and respectful way, do not say it. If you can not do it in a
        non-threatening and polite way, don’t do it.
        <h2>5. Don’t harass.</h2>
        In general, if someone asks you to stop something, then stop. When there is a disagreement with someone, try to
        understand why. Differences in opinion and disagreements are inevitable. What is important is that we address
        and resolve these disagreements constructively. Sometimes, you will have to agree to disagree and move on.
        <h2>6. What are the consequences of unacceptable behavior?</h2>
        Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated whether by other attendees, media, speakers, volunteers, organizers,
        venue staff, sponsors, or exhibitors.
        Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply.
        If you engage in unacceptable behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up
        to and including expulsion from the conference without warning or refund.
        <h2>7. What to do if you are subjected to or a witness of unacceptable behavior?</h2>
        Please try to resolve your disagreements in a constructive manner keeping in mind the points outlined above. If
        someone behaves inappropriately towards you, ask them to stop.
        If the situation can not be resolved, please notify a conference organizer as soon as possible. The same applies
        if you are a witness to unacceptable behavior.
        All reports will remain completely confidential.
        The Haxe Summit team will be available to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement if
        necessary to resolve a given situation. You can report unacceptable behavior to any member of staff. Staff can
        be found onsite or you may email one of the contacts below.
        <h2>8. Scope</h2>
        We expect all conference participants (sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other guests) to abide by
        this code of conduct at all conference venues and conference-related social events.
