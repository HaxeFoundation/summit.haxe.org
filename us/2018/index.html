                    <h2>Join us on the Summit!</h2>

                    <p>The US Haxe Summit 2018 is a three day event taking place in Seattle in May 2018. It will be a
                        great opportunity to meet with the US community of Haxe professionals and interested developers.
                        Of course, we will also have international visitors and speakers.</p>

                    <p>If you are currently evaluating Haxe or looking to learn more about it, the conference is a great
                        way to meet people who can answer your questions about the technology.</p>
                    <p>If you are a Haxe developer, you’ll enjoy connecting with the community and getting some fresh
                        ideas, inspiration and learning a few things you didn't know about Haxe yet.
                    </p>
                    <p>The schedule will have a nice mix of talks, workshops and panel discussions. The talks will give
                        you a peek into new and interesting Haxe projects while the workshops will be a good opportunity
                        to get some hands on experience or learn more about tools that you have been curious about.</p>
                    <p>We are looking forward to having you join us in Seattle!</p>

<p>Usually I wake up early with some exciting new thing I want to code.</p><ul><li><strong> How about Wednesday night? </strong></li></ul>
<p>I often watch a movie.</p><ul><li><strong> What was awesome about last year?</strong></li></ul>
<p>The Haxe Summit ! - And Northgard Early access that was very well received</p><ul><li><strong> What are you looking forward to this year?</strong></li></ul>
<p>The Haxe Summit ! - And looking forward to reception of my newest games.</p><ul><li><strong> What is the first thing you ever used coding for?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Making games</p><ul><li><strong> Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:</strong></li></ul>
<p>DRY KISS are two important concepts. "Beautiful code is not when there's nothing left to add, but when there's nothing left to remove."
Syntax is mostly irrelevant and way too much time is spent discussing about it, whereas what is very important is semantic.</p><ul><li><strong> How does Haxe come into that?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Macros helps a lot creating nicer APIs and carrying developer will into the final code.</p><ul><li><strong> What was your first Haxe project?</strong></li></ul>
<p>trace("Hello World"); I guess that was actually the first Haxe Project ever :) It took a bit of time to get it working correctly, back in the days.</p><ul><li><strong> Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:</strong></li></ul>
<p>It's not yet announced so I can't tell much about it yet. It's a cool game :)</p><ul><li><strong>Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:</strong></li></ul>
<p>With Haxe you can develop your desktop application, your server, you front and back end, your web and mobiles apps. With one single code base.</p><ul><li><strong> If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I would have worked on HashLink before.</p><ul><li><strong> If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>The fact that it's very easy to get started, yet has a nice learning curve to become a better developer.</p><ul><li><strong> You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (let’s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:</strong></li></ul>
<p>There's a macro for it!</p><ul><li><strong> Last thoughts: </strong></li></ul>
<p>See you at Haxe Summit!</p></div>

                                 <p>Golgi is a routing library that is geared for speed and composability. 
Golgi uses a macro-generated class interface as a route dispatch table.<br />
Rather than writing complex global route patterns, simply start writing a standard class that extends Golgi, and enjoy extremely fast routing and flexible composition for all your routing needs.</p>

Yeah, I write music, and if the weather is not a total disaster, I take time to have a walk with a podcast in my headphones.</p><ul><li><strong> How about Wednesday night? </strong></li></ul>
<p>Nothing particular, I just avoid to eat after 12 to keep my Gizmo spirit.</p><ul><li><strong> What was awesome about last year?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I freed my mind from 2 years of slavery. Be back to music helped a lot. Ghosts are gone now. Blow with the wind.</p><ul><li><strong> What are you looking forward to this year?</strong></li></ul>
<p>To meet my best friend in France in her new apartment. The main party will be in my heart.</p><ul><li><strong> What is the first thing you ever used coding for?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Nothing fancy. It was a program for latin declinations. I didn't have a computer at this time. I did it on the Apple II of my college.

<p>Haxe is my new girlifriend, till AS3 left with the kids, and all the other ones didn't bring so much love when darkness rushed in my life. I still remember when for the 1st time she told me: "Do you want to play with macros?".

<p>A unit-test framework, that I wrote previously in typescript, just the week before. Was a nice exercise to discover the basics.</p><ul><li><strong> Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:</strong></li></ul>
<p>It's called hexMachina, it's a community project, an architectural framework born in 2003/2004 (in AS2). I work on it daily and we use it at Docler as a foundation for one of our products.</p><ul><li><strong>Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:</strong></li></ul>
<p>I think it was when I realized that I could create my own DSL, a compile time DSL (oh man!) that could even describe itself. Like many developers, I was fascinated by getting some tools to create my own domain language. Haxe gave to me this opportunity, and much more than I could expect... When a general purpose language is capable to redesign itself, it gives you a taste of infinity. Haxe reconciled me to programming.</p><ul><li><strong> If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Reliable compiler services, and bring back Simn from Zelda's world.</p><ul><li><strong> If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Macros. It's one of the best tools ever made.

                        <div><ul><li><strong> What do you do on a Saturday morning? </strong></li></ul>
<p>It really varies! Sunday mornings I usually go for a run, but Saturday mornings I like to be walking around, exploring the city, hiking, or just sleeping in and enjoying brunch with friends if the weather isn't cooperating.</p><ul><li><strong> How about Wednesday night? </strong></li></ul>
<p>Wednesday night is cooking something interesting for dinner at home or hanging out with friends, either to play board games, discuss books, or go to a talk or show. In the summer it might be an outdoor concert.</p><ul><li><strong> What was awesome about last year?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I started doing a lot more running with a team here, and that's been a lot of fun.</p><ul><li><strong> What are you looking forward to this year?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Haxe 4.0! I'm also hoping to release one or more online multiplayer games, and looking forward to interacting with the players on them.</p><ul><li><strong> What is the first thing you ever used coding for?</strong></li></ul>
<p>When I was six years old my mom and I used to type in games from magazines that were printed out in Basic, and save them to tape! There were always typos and bugs, but once we got the game working I would be able to mess around with the code to see what would happen. It was both frustrating as well as a lot of fun. And it led to a lifetime of enjoying programming and creative work.</p><ul><li><strong> Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:</strong></li></ul>
<p>It's clear to me that a lot of the work we do as programmers is repetitive, and therefore ripe for automation. Things like boilerplate code, common idioms, re-specification of the same thing more than once, and structures that we employ in a repeated fashion to facilitate design patterns. Succinct code makes it easier to make changes and correct problems, and removing these repetitive tasks can improve our ability to get things done.</p><ul><li><strong> How does Haxe come into that?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Haxe has a wonderful type system that helps in several ways. First of all, it removes much of one pointless burden from the programmer: the re-specification of types where they are easily implied. When refactoring or changing things, this means fewer conflicts and less writing. Additionally, its support of Abstracts and static imports allows code to be written in a more natural location and can contribute to both readability and type safety, leading to fewer defects.</p><ul><li><strong> What was your first Haxe project?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Dungeon Punks, a console game we released on PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One, PC, and the web in late 2016.</p><ul><li><strong> Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:</strong></li></ul>
<p>I'm currently working on a variety of game creation tools and small multiplayer games. I've also recently been using Haxe to create some experimental programming language tools.</p><ul><li><strong>Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:</strong></li></ul>
<p>If you want to write code in an elegant and easy to use language that you'll be able to keep re-using on future projects on practically any platform, there are few good choices other than Haxe. You could use C++, but it's fairly slow to compile, rather painful in terms of cross-platform concerns, and tricky to say the least if you want to run code on the web. You could use Javascript, but it's not highly performant and you might have a tough time porting the runtime to some environments. And there are others you can use for desktop platforms. But for breadth, re-use, and code quality, it's hard to find a language that compares to Haxe.</p><ul><li><strong> If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I would make initialization of member variables consistent across all target platforms, to avoid surprises when running on a new target. (i.e. Float should always start out as the same value regardless of target platform)</p><ul><li><strong> If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Hard to say... because it always seems to change for the better!</p><ul><li><strong> You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (let’s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:</strong></li></ul>

                                 <p>Remember LAMP -- the Linux / Apache / MySQL / PHP web stack? Ahh the (good?) ol’ days. We’ll build a web app on Linux from the ground up with a Node.js backend, Mongo database, and modular HTML5 widgets on the frontend -- all using Haxe. Maybe we’ll throw in SocketIO or Google SSO, just for fun. I’ll showcase a number of handy Haxe macros, components, and best practices I've picked up along the way. </p>

                        <div><ul><li><strong> What do you do on a Saturday morning? </strong></li></ul>
<p>Sleep in... then make a big breakfast for the family! Weekday mornings I usually skip breakfast and just drink coffee. So Saturday breakfasts are special.</p><ul><li><strong> How about Wednesday night? </strong></li></ul>
<p>Wednesday's are hectic dad mode -- my wife goes to a ladies group, and the kids have various activities. So I'm doing well just to keep everyone alive. "Bonus points" if they're in bed on time. "Epic win" if they took showers, finished homework, and didn't eat ice cream for dinner.</p><ul><li><strong> What was awesome about last year?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I really enjoy playing piano. I'm not very good at it, but I'm learning, and so in the past (couple) years, I've been making good strides in that. I combine that with my love of technology through the use of a digital keyboard, midi controllers, and virtual instruments. A dream project is to leverage Haxe for scripting audio plugins or even creating virtual instruments.</p><ul><li><strong> What are you looking forward to this year?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I love learning and growing. No matter how much I learn, I’m always finding there’s more to know (The alarming rate at which I forget things maybe contributes to this. Ha!) I think some (perhaps most, perhaps all) people are created with a thirst for learning, for discovering the world and all it’s fascinating systems and designs. Right now I aspire to learn more the Haxe type system, the HL runtime, and other Haxe frameworks and best practices. I want to learn more about music, teaching, parenting, and God’s will for my life. I strive to never consider myself as having “arrived.”</p><ul><li><strong> What is the first thing you ever used coding for?</strong></li></ul>
<p>When I was about 6 years old, we got a Tandy 1000 SX (16 colors on that beast.) I scoured the local library and magazine rack for BASIC code snippets and really enjoyed the thrill of entering (and tweaking) the programs into the computer. At some point early on, I tried to make a paint program, then fighting and adventure games.</p><ul><li><strong> Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:</strong></li></ul>
<p>Ha, I try not to. But my basic philosophy toward coding is to build things that you enjoy and that are useful, and build them quickly. I like to build small, modular, à-la-carte pieces. The simpler the better. I tend to roll my own solutions, for better or worse, as I like to understand how things work. Rapid progress and iteration helps me stay engaged.</p><ul><li><strong> How does Haxe come into that?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Haxe is super efficient in a lot of ways: it’s a high-level language with garbage collection, closures, and complex data structures, its type system lets me express code in a self-documenting and future-proof way, the compiler helps me save time by avoiding typos and common mistakes, and of course, the cross-platform targets means that I can leverage code and expertise no matter what I’m working on. All this means I can prototype and build my projects very quickly, without sacrificing the robustness of the codebase.</p><ul><li><strong> What was your first Haxe project?</strong></li></ul>
<p>One of the first things I built in Haxe was a project called hxScout -- a bit ambitious, looking back! I wanted to be able to profile Haxe C++ applications in the same way I profiled Adobe AIR projects, so it was modeled after Adobe Scout. I didn’t know much about C++ or runtimes, so it was a great learning experience. It was also awesome getting to work closely with Haxians on the hxcpp side like Hugh, Lars, and Sven, as well as Joshua on the OpenFL side. And who can forget mild frustrations vented on the forums, with Juraj and others offering sound advice.</p><ul><li><strong> Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:</strong></li></ul>
<p>Right now I'm building Woot Math Polls - a real-time polling application focused on the math classroom. It's built with almost 100k lines of Haxe, targeting vanilla JS in the browser. Teachers can run quick polls in their classrooms to gauge student understanding. Polls goes beyond your basic quizzing interfaces -- multiple choice, short answer, real-time feedback -- by providing innovative features for math tasks: graphing, equations, tables, and checking algebraically equivalent answers. The frontend app itself is 100% Haxe, and some backend features are built on Node.js from our Haxe codebase. Other tech we use includes Ruby, Sidekiq, AngularJS, Riot.js, MySQL, and MongoDB.</p><ul><li><strong>Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:</strong></li></ul>
<p>Haxe is extremely efficient, offering developers the right balance of tools for rapid prototyping, expressiveness, and flexibility, all while preserving maintainable, self-documenting code.</p><ul><li><strong> If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>The biggest problem of Haxe is that not enough people use it. I would force more developers and organizations to adopt it <em>smile</em>. But seriously, maybe one of the causes of that is fragmentation. On many levels. The fragmentation of targets is inherent. As are framework and API preferences. There is also a steep learning curve that creates fragmentation of developer skill -- those who deeply understand Haxe and all the capability it provides, and those who just pick it up and want to build something fun. I think something that could help is an extra measure of respect, humility, and grace when interacting with the community. It’s important to realize we’re all enjoying this tool and using it for different purposes and with different experiences. And yet, Haxe must not lose its identity, maintaining a strong and consistent vision, so that there are core principles at the center of our diverse community.</p><ul><li><strong> If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I think that would be the core value of Haxe I mentioned above -- efficiency, expressiveness, flexibility, all while preserving maintainable, self-documenting code. As long as I can do that, Haxe will be my language... err, my weapon of choice.</p><ul><li><strong> You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (let’s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?).

<p>I really appreciate the Haxe community! Thanks to all the creators, contributors, target maintainers, framework authors, vocal supporters, issue filers, thought leaders, retweeters, and users of the Haxe ecosystem. Thanks to all who have personally helped and worked with me along the way. Cheers!</p></div>

<p>We use Haxe because it is an open source platform which allows us to target HTML5 and native mobile from a single codebase.

<p>JavaScript is flexible, simple to write and nearly ubiquitous, but it can be hard to optimize -- especially on mobile and embedded platforms. C/C++ is less flexible, and is usually slower to write, but is powerful for optimal performance.</p>

                                 <p>Literate programming is an old idea first championed by legendary computer scientist Donald Knuth. Here we will go over how some simple changes you can do to your build process to have literate haxe files, documentation that has functioning code built-into it. We also go over ways to bring literate haxe to the next level with the power of haxe macros.</p>

                        <div><ul><li><strong> What do you do on a Saturday morning? </strong></li></ul>
<p>Probably getting the kids ready for one of our weekend adventures.</p><ul><li><strong> How about Wednesday night? </strong></li></ul>
<p>Reading my kids a bedtime story, then afterward I might work on a hobby that can be done when I'm sleepy like starting the process of making a loaf of bread, making tortillas for later, etc.</p><ul><li><strong> What was awesome about last year?</strong></li></ul>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild coming out and also personally, getting settled into a new place. Also closing it off with being in Japan for almost a month and being able to work remotely while doing so.</p><ul><li><strong> What are you looking forward to this year?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Two huge road trips, finishing one of my major projects and one of my batches of mead finally maturing enough to be drinkable.</p><ul><li><strong> What is the first thing you ever used coding for?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Probably adding javascript for effects on a web page in my late teens. Other early contenders are using basic on my graphing calculator to cheat in math class (writing simple programs to do all the work for me) and a command-line application to quiz me in vocabulary when I was studying German, written in C.</p><ul><li><strong> Have you ever had any philosophical or aesthetic thoughts about code? Tell us a little about that:</strong></li></ul>
<p>Coding is like writing. No, coding is writing. But it must be readable by two audiences - humans and computers. The principles that apply to good writing, such as clarity and berevity, apply to coding. In the interest of allowing humans to understand what you wrote, you need to know when to tell the whole story depth first or when to give a reader's digest, allowing them to look up details in the function if they wish.</p><ul><li><strong> How does Haxe come into that?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Haxe is a modern object-oriented language with modern features that encourages encapsulation. While it has dynamic targets, it's type safety at compile-time allows you to be clear about what a thing is and avoid the plague of unclear writing, bad analogies.</p><ul><li><strong> What was your first Haxe project?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I made a game for toddlers using OpenFL in under a month, which you can get in the app store (Zany Faces).</p><ul><li><strong> Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:</strong></li></ul>
<p>Currently, I am working on a minimalistic horror hack and slash RPG I'm making and a 2D RPG/Visual novel engine for it.</p><ul><li><strong>Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:</strong></li></ul>
<p>If you have a complex client/server application in haxe, you can share the code between server and client without having to be married to a certain framework. If you like Xamarin for the client but want js on the server, you can write the common code (or, indeed, all of the code) in haxe. You can make the choice of where to run some parts of the code based on performance considerations without having to rewrite too much code.</p><ul><li><strong> If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>It would be self-hosting (haxe written in haxe). Bonus if it worked with any of the targets (so you could even have a js runtime compile haxe code if need be).</p><ul><li><strong> If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>The flexibility you have in unifying types and being able to specify an anonymous structure as the type.</p><ul><li><strong> You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (let’s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:</strong></li></ul>
<p>Front: Haxe: writes in javascript, so you don't have to. Back: a source listing of how a simple hello world program transpiles to various targets</p><ul><li><strong> Last thoughts: </strong></li></ul>
<p>Haxe is amazing technology and it needs some basic infrastructure like better IDE support to start finding greater adoption in other niches than gaming. I'm confident it will get there in the next few years.</p></div>

Traditional coding may be unintuitive since we do not have the WYSIWYG experience as in painting, but it doesn't mean coding is not a good painting tool. The generative art creation process is more like an exploration, in which we let the code shows us unexpected results.</p><ul><li><strong> How does Haxe come into that?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I like how Haxe can be used for very different things. I created some interactive installation and generative graphics with Haxe when I was in University. I built research prototypes and did data analysis with Haxe for my Ph.D. and my current employer. Since it is capable for many things, it let me explore more different areas.</p><ul><li><strong> What was your first Haxe project?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I ported CASALib, which was a collection of ActionScript utilities, to Haxe. I did that as a way to get familiar with the Haxe language and the standard library.</p><ul><li><strong> Tell us a little about your current Haxe project:</strong></li></ul>
<p>I'm more of a Haxe contributor than a user right now. At work, I'm mostly using Python (for deep learning). I've been finding ways to use the Haxe Python target instead but there are still some rough edges (e.g. operator overloading).</p><ul><li><strong>Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:</strong></li></ul>
<p>It is not a single use case, but the most awesome thing is Haxe is good at (almost) every use case.</p><ul><li><strong> If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Clearer separation of Haxe types and target types like how we have Haxe String vs cpp.NativeString. I think it would be nice to extend this concept to other types like Int, Array, Map, functions etc. It would be easier to write externs.</p><ul><li><strong> If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>That was a hard question... I like most aspects of Haxe but I can see potential improvements in every area. I would keep the C-like syntax since that's what I have settled, but that doesn't mean I want the syntax stay 100% unchanged. Some fine-tuning like the new function type syntax in Haxe 4 is pretty good.</p><ul><li><strong> You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (let’s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?).

                                 <p>I am a graphic and multimedia designer who became heavily invested in Flash then found a dream-come-true in Haxe when it became apparent that Flash would die. This presentation will be designed to whet the appetites of those people considering Haxe for browser-based interactivity, and show how it is a solid investment. I will present examples of different real-world projects done over nine years using different display methods including OpenFL, OpenLayers, EaselJS, DOM/CSS and SVG. I will explain the rationale in choosing the technologies for each solution, and discuss the process of doing Flash-to-Haxe conversion, dual-compiled interactive pieces, and working with external Javascript libraries. I will describe some of the options for IDEs today and my preferred development toolkit, and my perceived advantages of using Haxe going into the future.</p>

<p>Haxe is ideal for use in browser-based interactivity. 
Regarding the past, it is easy to port old Actionscript or Javascript code.
For the present, it has an excellent compiler and libraries, and integrates seamlessly with whatever external libraries (Javascript or others) you want to use. 
In the future, you will be positioned well to target whatever technologies become widespread, such as WebAssembly.</p><ul><li><strong> If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Because I don't use Haxe every day, I actually find the addition of new language features to be a bit too rapid for my ability to learn.</p><ul><li><strong> If there was one thing about Haxe that you could forever keep from changing, what would that be?</strong></li></ul>

                                 <p>Unveiling the next phase of Kha's multi-decade master plan this year's talk will focus on the delicate topic of cooperation across multiple big open source projects. It will demonstrate what Kha can do for other Haxe projects like HaxeUI, Heaps and OpenFL and address the technological and psychological challenges of such cooperation efforts. Besides all of that it will also include the yearly, general progress update on Kha.</p>

                                 <p>Kha has its own way of doing things but after two hours of intense Kha training it will also be your way of doing things. We will debug and profile code for multiple platforms and figure out robust and fast workflows.</p>

<p>Yes, but this was forced on me - I recently played through the "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream" game.</p><ul><li><strong> How does Haxe come into that?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Oh, I would sure hope Haxe didn't have anything to do with that.</p><ul><li><strong> What was your first Haxe project?</strong></li></ul>
<p>It was Kha.</p><ul><li><strong>Sell us on your most awesome Haxe use-case in five sentences or less:</strong></li></ul>
<p>With Haxe and Kha you can get even the fanciest graphical applications running everywhere - browsers, mobiles, consoles, even inside of other applications - and because it can cross-compile everything, this will continue to be the case, no matter what craziness the IT giants come up with next.</p><ul><li><strong> If you could change one thing about Haxe, what would it be?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Optional manual memory management it would be.</p><ul><li><strong> You are getting a Haxe T-Shirt and have to wear it to work every day (let’s assume it is self-cleaning, ok?). The T-Shirt says:</strong></li></ul>

                    <h3>May 03 @ 10:30 - 11:15</h3>
                    <p>Unveiling the next phase of Kha's multi-decade master plan this year's talk will focus on the delicate topic of cooperation across multiple big open source projects. It will demonstrate what Kha can do for other Haxe projects like HaxeUI, Heaps and OpenFL and address the technological and psychological challenges of such cooperation efforts. Besides all of that it will also include the yearly, general progress update on Kha.</p>

                    <p>Using a project.hxp file allows you write your OpenFL project configuration in Haxe. This makes it possible to implement complex, dynamic project behavior that would be incredibly difficult - or even impossible - to accomplish with an XML project file.
Come learn the basics of configuring an OpenFL project with Haxe. Then see some examples of how FlowPlay is utilizing this to feature to not only make project maintenance easier, but also improve day-to-day developer productivity.</p>

                    <p>One of the many advantages of Haxe is that it makes it easy to target multiple platforms with your code. Most mobile games, however, need to integrate 3rd party native extensions for things like IAP, analytics, ads, crash reporting and other business critical features using Haxe native extensions. Writing Haxe native extensions can be complicated, especially for developers who don't have native development experience. This talk is meant to help make it easier for developers to write their own native extensions.</p>

                    <p>Literate programming is an old idea first championed by legendary computer scientist Donald Knuth. Here we will go over how some simple changes you can do to your build process to have literate haxe files, documentation that has functioning code built-into it. We also go over ways to bring literate haxe to the next level with the power of haxe macros.</p>

                    <p>Remember LAMP -- the Linux / Apache / MySQL / PHP web stack? Ahh the (good?) ol’ days. We’ll build a web app on Linux from the ground up with a Node.js backend, Mongo database, and modular HTML5 widgets on the frontend -- all using Haxe. Maybe we’ll throw in SocketIO or Google SSO, just for fun. I’ll showcase a number of handy Haxe macros, components, and best practices I've picked up along the way. </p>

                    <p>Golgi is a routing library that is geared for speed and composability. 
Golgi uses a macro-generated class interface as a route dispatch table.<br />
Rather than writing complex global route patterns, simply start writing a standard class that extends Golgi, and enjoy extremely fast routing and flexible composition for all your routing needs.</p>

                    <p>I am a graphic and multimedia designer who became heavily invested in Flash then found a dream-come-true in Haxe when it became apparent that Flash would die. This presentation will be designed to whet the appetites of those people considering Haxe for browser-based interactivity, and show how it is a solid investment. I will present examples of different real-world projects done over nine years using different display methods including OpenFL, OpenLayers, EaselJS, DOM/CSS and SVG. I will explain the rationale in choosing the technologies for each solution, and discuss the process of doing Flash-to-Haxe conversion, dual-compiled interactive pieces, and working with external Javascript libraries. I will describe some of the options for IDEs today and my preferred development toolkit, and my perceived advantages of using Haxe going into the future.</p>

                    <h1>Console Punks: Haxe for Xbox, PlayStation, and Beyond</h1>
                    <h3>May 05 @ 14:00 - 14:45</h3>
                    <p>In late 2016 we released "Dungeon Punks" on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Steam, and the Web. We share our experiences including what went wrong and what went right targeting this diverse set of platforms using an unorthodox combination of Haxe and Unity. This talk should be relevant for anyone interested in doing console game development using Haxe. We will cover both our unusual technical approach as well as our thoughts on what methods might be useful going forward on future cross-platform game projects. Pitfalls unique to console development will be covered in a way that is relevant across a variety of technologies and engine choices. </p>

                    <p>Heaps.io is an open source 2D/3D game framework that was used to develop successful commercial games Evoland 1&amp;2, Dead Cells, Northgard and many other smaller non commercial games.
Nicolas will introduce the framework, explain how it can be used for Desktop, Mobile, Web and Consoles, what tools are available, answer any question you might have and give a few tips of its own.</p>
